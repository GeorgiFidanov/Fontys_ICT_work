        <h1>How to Play: Guess the Word</h1>
        
        <h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
        <p>The goal of the game is simple: guess the secret word. You have a limited number of chances to guess the word correctly by suggesting letters one at a time.</p>
        
        <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
        <div class="rules">
            <ul>
                <li>A word is chosen at random and the number of letters in the word is displayed as underscores ( _ ).</li>
                <li>Players take turns guessing one letter at a time.</li>
                <li>If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position(s).</li>
                <li>If the guessed letter is not in the word, one chance is lost.</li>
                <li>The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before they lose the game.</li>
                <li>The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>How to Make a Guess</h2>
        <p>When it’s your turn, think of a letter that could be in the word. If you're not sure, try common vowels (a, e, i, o, u) or frequently used consonants (r, s, t, l, n).</p>
        
        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>You win the game if you reveal all the letters of the secret word before you run out of guesses. Pay attention to the letters that have already been guessed to help you narrow down the options.</p>

        <h2>Helpful Tips</h2>
        <div class="tips">
            <ul>
                <li>Start by guessing common letters (e.g., vowels and frequently used consonants).</li>
                <li>Observe any patterns in the word as letters are revealed.</li>
                <li>Don’t be afraid to guess a letter even if you are unsure.</li>
                <li>Remember, you have a limited number of wrong guesses, so choose wisely!</li>
            </ul>
