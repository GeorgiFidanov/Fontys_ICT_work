Temperature vs. Plant Height (Yield):
        The plant height increases significantly between temperatures of 16°C to 24°C and then slightly decreases as the temperature rises beyond 24°C.
        This suggests that the optimal temperature for maximum yield is around 24°C.

Temperature vs. Cost:
        The cost to maintain the temperature increases exponentially as the temperature rises.
        This indicates that higher temperatures are more expensive to maintain, especially beyond 24°C.

Humidity vs. Plant Height (Yield):
        The plant height peaks when the relative humidity is between 75% to 85% and then decreases slightly as the humidity continues to increase.
        This implies that the ideal humidity range for maximum yield is between 75% to 85%.

Humidity vs. Cost:
        The cost to maintain humidity increases steadily as the humidity level rises.
        Higher humidity levels are more expensive to maintain.

Conclusion for Optimal Conditions
    	Optimal Temperature: Around 24°C.
    	Optimal Humidity: Between 75% to 85%.
