Network components:

1. Router

    Connects the local networks (internal employee network, customer network, and system network) to the internet. It also allows for communication between the fast-food chain location and the headquarters.

2. Firewall

    Crucial for protecting both the internal employee network and the system network (e.g., cash registers) from external threats and unauthorized access. It also helps to segment the networks.

3. Switch

    Connect multiple devices (e.g., cash registers, employee devices, system servers) on the same network. They are essential for both the internal network for systems and employees.

4. Wireless Access Points (WAPs)

    Provide Wi-Fi access for customers and employees. Different WAPs should be used for customer and employee networks to ensure proper segmentation.

5. VLAN-capable Switch

    Allow for network segmentation. A VLAN switch will help keep the customer network separate from internal networks, preventing unnecessary traffic and ensuring security.

6. VPN Gateway

    Allows secure remote access to the headquarters. A VPN provides encryption to ensure that sensitive data (e.g., sales information) can be sent securely.

7. DHCP Server

    Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on each network (customer, employee, and systems).

8. Servers

        File Server: For storing employee files and sales records.
        POS System Server: For processing orders and managing inventory.
        Connection to Headquarters: For real-time syncing of sales data, inventory, and other operational data with HQ.

9. POS Terminals (Cash Registers)

    Essential for sales transactions and need to be connected to the internal network for systems to access the POS server.

10. Ethernet Cables

    Necessary for wired connections between network devices (routers, switches, servers, POS systems).
